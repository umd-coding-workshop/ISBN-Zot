ISBN-Zot
========

Some code for an eventual iPhone app that uses the phone's camera to read ISBNs from books, looks up the books in an online resource such as Library of Congress's Search-Retrieve-Via-URL service (1), and automatically imports the retrieved catalog info into the user's Zotero repository (2).
